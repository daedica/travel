Railway travel is a special world, which has its own connoisseurs. And if you go on extra-class trains, it will create the illusion of a return to the past era, when there were no planes and cars just started to develop. Such trains exist, but you cannot buy tickets for them at a regular ticket office. They take tourists on special routes, combining luxury vacation in the compartment and entertainment on the way with exciting excursions at the stops.
