Railway travel is a special world, which has its own connoisseurs. And if you go on extra-class trains, it will create the illusion of a return to the past era, when there were no planes and cars just started to develop. Such trains exist, but you cannot buy tickets for them at a regular ticket office. They take tourists on special routes, combining luxury vacation in the compartment and entertainment on the way with exciting excursions at the stops.

The composition consists of ancient cars of the 20-30s of the XX century, restored and decorated in Art Deco style. The luxurious train's interior literally breathes with history and creates a special atmosphere of sophistication and elegance of a bygone era. High quality service, excellent dishes and exquisite wine list are the integral part of the trip. Dress code also creates magic atmosphere. Jeans are considered to be mauveton here, and it is customary to come to the restaurant's car for dinner in evening dresses and tuxedos with bow ties.

Inquisitive fact from Novate.ru: The first trip the Orient-Express train made on October 4, 1883. Soon it was turned into a luxury vehicle and traveled on the route until 1960. The train owes its revival to Agatha Christie and Sidney Lumet, who filmed the novel by the writer. Orient-Express is the same train in which the detective action "Murder on the Orient Express" was unfolding. Lumet managed to find two rare cars for filming the film. Later they were sold at an auction to James Sherwood.
